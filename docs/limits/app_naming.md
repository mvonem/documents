## Application naming

When registering your applications, make sure you keep in mind the following:
- the name must be unique; this is enforced by the create application form
- the name should have one word, or multiple without spaces
- choose a significant and easy to remember name; keep in mind that users will use # followed by the name you choose to access your application

For free plans, the name will be automatically assigned to your application.
<!-- to confirm this is still in place -->
